🔒 Project Description
This repository contains all the necessary files required to depict steganography, developed during my internship at Connecting Dream Foundation. The project demonstrates the practical application of steganography techniques for securely hiding messages within digital images, enhancing digital security and confidentiality.

📜 Project Overview
The project implements a robust steganography solution that embeds secret messages directly into the RGB matrix of images, making the alterations invisible to the naked eye. It features a user-friendly interface for both encoding and decoding messages, along with password protection to ensure that only authorized users can access the hidden information.

✨ Key Features
Message Encoding: Securely embed messages within the pixel values of an image without affecting its visual appearance.
Message Decoding: Retrieve the hidden message from the image using a password-protected decryption process.
Password Protection: Ensure that only users with the correct password can decrypt and read the hidden message.
Image Handling: Utilize OpenCV and PIL for efficient image processing and manipulation.
Graphical User Interface: Tkinter-based interface for intuitive interaction with the encryption and decryption processes.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Designed to work seamlessly on various operating systems.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for the project.
OpenCV: For image reading, manipulation, and saving.
PIL (Pillow): For advanced image processing and compatibility with Tkinter.
Tkinter: For creating a graphical user interface that simplifies user interaction.
OS Module: For file handling operations and opening encoded images.

📚 Usage
--->Encrypting a Message
Enter Message: Enter the message and password in the provided fields.
Encrypt: Click the "Encrypt" button to embed the message in the image.
Save and Open: The encoded image will be saved and opened automatically.
--->Decrypting a Message
Open Encoded Image: Open the encoded image using the provided interface.
Enter Password: Enter the password to decrypt and reveal the hidden message.
